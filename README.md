ID3 Type Provider
=================

The ID3 type provider is a simple F# type provider for reading ID3 tags from an MP3 file. It was created as a way to experiment with type providers and learn how they work. It is hardly a full-featured ID3 reader and it serves little purpose beyond being a teaching aid although it is fun to play with.
